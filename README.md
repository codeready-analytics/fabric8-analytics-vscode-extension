# Dependency Analytics

 Application stack analysis report with Insights about your application dependencies:
- Flags a security vulnerability(CVE) and suggests a remedial version
- Shows Github popularity metrics along with latest version
- Suggests a project level license, check for conflicts between dependency licences
- AI based guidance for alternative dependencies
- AI based guidance for additional dependencies 

## Supported Languages

 'Dependency Analytics' extension supports projects using Maven and projects build on npm (Node ecosystem). 
Extending support for Python and Go languages is currently under progress.

## Prerequisites
* **For analyzing Java applications** Maven must be installed on your machine. Provide the Maven executable filepath.
* **For analyzing Node applications** Node and npm must be installed on your machine. Provide the npm executable filepath.

> **Note:** By default, the `mvn/npm` command is executed directly in the terminal, which requires that  `mvn/npm` is found in your system environment `PATH`.           
 If you do not want to add it into your system environment `PATH`, you can specify the maven executable path in settings. You can do this via preferences in VS Code:

 File/Code > Preferences

```
{
    ...
    "maven.executable.path": "/path-to-maven-home/bin/mvn"
    "npm.executable.path": "/path-to-npm-home/bin/npm"
    ...
}
```

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension.

2. How to use ?

  - Open or edit a manifest file (`pom.xml` / `package.json`) to flag any CVEs present in your application
  - Right click on a manifest file (`pom.xml`/`package.json`) in the 'Vscode File explorer' or  'Vscode File editor' to display 'Application stack analysis report' for your application.

Alerts for any CVEs are shown in the **PROBLEMS** tab when you open the `pom.xml / package.json` manifest file.

## Usage

You can get 'Application stack analysis report' with Insights (Security, License and guidance for additional/alternative) about your application dependencies

To view the 'Application's stack analysis report' for a specific module:
1. Open a manifest file (`pom.xml`, `package.json`).
2. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, and then click **Generate application stack report on manifest file** to see the application's stack analysis report for the manifest file.


To view the 'Application's stack analysis report' for the entire project (including multiple sub-modules):
* Use command `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, and then click **Generate application stack report on Workspace** to view the application's stack analysis report for the entire workspace/project.

## Note

It creates a folder `target` in workspace which is used for processing of manifest files, needed for generating stack report. So kindly add `target` in `.gitignore`.

### Develop this extension

1. Install the dependencies:
`npm install`.
2. Start the compiler in watch mode:
